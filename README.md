myclementine.py - shows current track played in Clementine, unlike the original clementine.py script, mine uses newer dbus syntax so it works in modern systems

svatky.py - has meaning only for czechs :) - ukazuje české svátky

myimap.py - my version of original imap.py script - uses gpg encoded passwords from external file (no passwords in the configuration file)
