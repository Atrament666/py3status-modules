myclementine.py - shows current track played in Clementine, unlike the original clementine.py script, mine uses newer dbus syntax so it works in modern systems (requires dbus-python and Clementine)

svatky.py - has meaning only for czechs :) - ukazuje české svátky

myimap.py - my version of original imap.py script - uses gpg encoded passwords from external file (no passwords in configuration file) (requires gnupg) 

gbp_czk_rate.py - displays current GBP to CZK currency rate (requires lxml)
